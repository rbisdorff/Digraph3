The C file perrinMIS.c is computing the set of maximal independent sets MISs(n) of the n-cycle graph for n > 20 with the Perrin sequence algorithm - MISs(n) is obtained from  MISs(n-2) and  MISs(n-3) - by using recursively temporary data files.

The algorithm is even versus odd graph order optimized.

The final result in 01 format is available in the file <curd.dat>.

See https://digraph3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#computing-a-non-isomorphic-mis

To compile on Unix type machines with the GNU C Compiler:
...$gcc -Wall -O3 -o perrinMIS perrinMIS.c

To install automatically with the Digraph3 make file:

.../Digraph3/$ make installPerrin

By default the perrinMIS command is installed system-wide with sudo into /usr/local/bin. This may be changed with setting explicitely the INSTALLDIR flag.

To install into the user's bin directory :

.../Digraph3/$ make installPerrinUser
