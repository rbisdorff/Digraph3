This Python3 software resources implement decision aid algorithms useful in the field of 
Algorithmic Decision Theory and more specifically 
in outranking based Multiple Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA).

Installation instructions:

On a (Unix, Mac OSX) command line using a git client and either, cloning from github.com:

...$ git clone https://github.com/rbisdorff/Digraph3

or, from sourceforge.net:

...$ git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/digraph3/code Digraph3

You may also download and extract a zip archive fom the github link above, or a 
 zip archive (not always the latest) from 

https://sourceforge.net/projects/digraph3/.

On Linux or Mac OS, ..$ *cd* to the extracted <Digraph3> directory::

     ../Digraph3$ make installVenv
          
installs the Digraph3 modules in an activated virtual Python environment (the official python recommended option), or in the user's local python3 *site-packages*. Whereas::

     ../Digraph3$ make install

installs (with *sudo ${PYTHON} setup.py*) the Digraph3 modules system wide in the current running python environment. Python 3.8 (or later) environment is recommended (see the makefile for adapting to your *PYTHON* make constant). 

From Python3.10.4 on, the *distutils* package and the direct usage of *setup.py* are deprecated. The instead recommended installation via the *pip* module is provided with::

     ../Digraph3$ make installPip

This *make* command  launches in fact a *${PYTHON} -m pip -v install --upgrade --scr = .* command that installs the Digraph3 modules in the running virtual environment (recommended option) or the user's local *site-packages* directory. A system wide installation is possible with prefixing the *make installPip* commad with *sudo*.

If the cython C-compiled modules for Big Data are required, the Cython package must previously be installed in the running Python environment (...$ python3 -m pip install cython).

.. /Digraph3$ make tests

runs a pytest suite in the ./test directory ( python3 pytest package required  ...$ python3 -m pip install pytest )

.. /Digraph3$ make verboseTests
runs a verbose (with stdout not captured) pytest suite 

Tutorials and technical documentation of modules, classes and methods are available under the following link:
