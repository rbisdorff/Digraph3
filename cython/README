Installation instructions:

../Digraph3/cython$ make install
installs (with sudo !!) cythonized Digraph3 modules in the current running python3 environment. 

Pythhon 3.5+ environment is recommemded and a cython compiler is required (...$pip3.5+ install cython). 

In case of a virtual environment, use:
../Digraph3/cython$ make installVenv

Nose tests are gathered in the Digraph3/cython/Test directory (...$ pip3 install nose ):
.. /Digraph3/cython$ make tests
Runs a nose test suite providing programming examples

A sample program example testCythonInteger.py is also included in the Test directory.

Notice that the cythonized versions of the corresponding standard modules are only meant for big data problems with several thousands of decision actions. Decision actions keys are integers. All Decimal evaluations are replaced with flooat. Conversion from and to standard performance tableaux are provided both in the standard and in the cythonized modules. The cythonized outranking digraph model takes an integer valuation domain. The main reason consists in accelerating the computation of outranking characteristics.

Enjoy !!
