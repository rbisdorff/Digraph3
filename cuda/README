This Digraph3 module experiments the use of NVIDIA GPU resources for experimenting the speeding up of the elementwise computation of the codual transform for cIntegerOurankingDigraphs.IntegerBipolarOutrankingDigraph objects. 

Tests of the module may be found in the scratch part at the end of the module source file.

For this purpose, the relation attribute, a double dictionary, is replaced with a numpy two dimensional int32 array. 

Tutorials and technical documentation of modules, classes and methods are available under the following link:

Enjoy !!
