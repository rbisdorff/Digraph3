Introduction
------------

From 2007 to 2011 the Algorithmic Decision Theory COST Action IC0602, coordinated by Alexis Tsouki√†s, gathered researchers coming from different fields such as *Decision Theory*, *Discrete Mathematics*, *Theoretical Computer Science* and *Artificial Intelligence* in order to improve decision support in the presence of **massive data bases**, **combinatorial structures**, **partial** and/or **uncertain information** and **distributed**, possibly **interoperating decision makers**.

A positive result a.o. of this COST action was the organisation from 2012 to 2020 of a Semester Course on |location_link4| at the *University of Luxembourg* in the context of its **Master in Information and Computer Science**.

Below are gathered 2x2 reduced copies of the presentation slides for 12 Lectures from the Summer Semester 2020.
